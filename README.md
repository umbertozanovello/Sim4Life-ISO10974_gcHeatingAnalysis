# sim4life_GC_WorstOrientation

The script allows to automatically compute the direction of a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field that maximises the power deposited into an implant or the following maximum temperature increase. The analysis is in line with the test recommended by the ISO/TS 10974:2018 standard with regard to switched gradient field heating.<br>
The script requires Sim4Life togehter with a valid licence of the *Quasi-Static EM Solvers* and the *Thermal solver*
